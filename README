This is a html5 clone of the awesome ipad app "aelios weather".

I'm releasing this almost a year ago, after it sat lonely on my HD and collected dust.   
I instantly fell in love with aelios idea and execution, and I wanted to see if it can be re-created with html5 technologies. Many of the functionality is still missing, there's no "week view" and the weather while almost working is a dud.   
Fork me on github and help me out, we can make this project a beauty 

Features : 
*   Smart location selector - locks to the most highly populated location
*   24 hour virtual watch - showing midnight and noon times, featuring day and nighttime indicators
*   Rotation dial - turn the ring to see the shutter effect
